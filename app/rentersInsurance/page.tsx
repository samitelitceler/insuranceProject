            Anyone who rents should have a renters insurance policy for the best
            protection. Maybe you&apos;re a college student renting your first
            apartment. Or, maybe you&apos;re renting while building your dream home.
            No matter how you rent, renters insurance is a must to protect your
            valuable belongings. Anchor Insurance Agency provides high-quality,
            customized insurance policies to renters throughout Minnesota,
            Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Colorado. Plus, we&apos;re here

            Why Should I Have Renters Insurance?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-[18px] text-[#393939] text-left font-opensans font-medium leading-[30px] mb-5">
            It&apos;s a common misconception that renters insurance is only a &quot;nice
            to have&quot; instead of a &quot;must-have.&quot; After all, many landlords still
            don&apos;t require you to carry separate insurance. The truth is that any
            renter should have insurance to ensure their belongings are
            protected. For example, if a fire broke out in your apartment
            complex, your landlord&apos;s insurance would cover the damage to the
            building. Yet, the landlord&apos;s insurance won&apos;t cover the loss of your
            personal belongings. It also won&apos;t cover the cost of someone getting
            hurt while visiting your home or property stolen due to a break-in.
